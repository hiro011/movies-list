# Movie List Manager

This is a simple web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to manage a personal list of their favorite movies directly within their browser. You can easily add new movies, edit their details, rearrange their order, and remove them from the list. All data is stored locally in your browser's storage, ensuring your list is persistent across sessions on the same device.

## Features

* **Add Movie:** Easily add new movies to your library by providing a name, image URL, and a link.
* **Edit Movie:** Modify the details (name, image URL, link) of existing movies in your list.
* **Move Movie:** Reorder your movie list by dragging and dropping items to your preferred position.
* **Delete Movie:** Remove movies from your library with a simple click.
* **Search:** Quickly find movies in your library using the search bar. The list updates in real-time as you type.
* **Local Storage:** Your movie library is saved directly in your browser's local storage, meaning no external database or server is required.
* **Movie Details:** Each movie entry in the list displays its name, an optional image, and a link to the movie's website (e.g., IMDb, streaming service).

## Local Storage

This application utilizes your browser's local storage to save your movie library. This means:

* Your data is stored directly within your web browser and is specific to that browser on your current device.
* Your movie list will persist even if you close the browser and open it again later.
* Clearing your browser's local storage will also remove the saved movie library.
